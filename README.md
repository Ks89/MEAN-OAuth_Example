# Example

It you want to run this example with nodemon, you must create a ".env" file into the root folder with this text:

FACEBOOK_APP_ID=-insert your key here-
FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET=-insert your key here-

GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=-insert your key here-
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=-insert your key here-

GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=-insert your key here-
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=-insert your key here-

replacing "-insert your key here-" with your real keys.
