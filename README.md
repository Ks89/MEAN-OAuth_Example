# Example

It you want to run this example with nodemon, you must create a ".env" file into the root folder with this text:
<br/>
<br/>

    FACEBOOK_APP_ID=-insert your key here-
    FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET=-insert your key here-
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=-insert your key here-
    GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=-insert your key here-
    GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=-insert your key here-
    GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=-insert your key here-

replacing "-insert your key here-" with your real keys.
